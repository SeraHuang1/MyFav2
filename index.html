  <h1> My Favorite Hobby </h1>
  <h2> Reading Books(I have others)
  </h2>  
  <section> 
  <p> My hobby, is reading books. I like reading books because they can be humorous, action filled, fiction-ized, or sad! Books are an emotional rollercoaster and can be weird(in a good way) or crazy(in a good way). I am in 5th grade, 9 years old(I skipped a grade) and I am reading 7th+ grade level. Reading can be developed naturally, or technically. I was a late bloomer but I'm serious, it literally happened overnight. It is an amazing hobby and of course I have others as well.
